## Overview

In this project, I developed a sophisticated Trading Toolkit application aimed at revolutionizing trading decisions by removing guesswork for traders. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Electron, Stonkify empowers traders with powerful tools and real-time data analysis, enabling them to make informed and strategic decisions in the financial markets.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Market Scanners**: Provides high of day, low of day, and unusual high relative volume scanners, delivering critical market insights to traders.
- **News Scanner with Sentiment Analysis**: Offers up-to-the-minute news and market sentiment analysis to inform trading strategies.
- **Single Stock Window**: Allows instant access to stock-specific news and data with a single click, enhancing decision-making speed.
- **Crypto Volume Monitor**: Extends market analysis to cryptocurrencies, enabling traders to capitalize on opportunities in both traditional and crypto markets.
- **Custom Hotkeys and Mouse Hooks**: Enhances efficiency and precision by enabling rapid data analysis and swift trade execution through customizable keyboard and mouse shortcuts, leveraging Electron's ability to interact with low-level system events.

## Technologies Used

- **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js):** For building a robust and scalable application with seamless integration of components.
- **Electron:** For cross-platform compatibility, ensuring consistent performance across various operating systems and enabling interaction with low-level system events for hotkeys and mouse hooks.
- **Real-Time Data Integration:** For providing traders with up-to-date market data and analytics.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was integrating keyboard and mouse hooks between the toolkit and trading software while ensuring security measures to safeguard user data. Implementing this functionality required in-depth knowledge of low-level system interactions and careful handling of user permissions. Additionally, balancing a feature-rich application with a user-friendly interface was essential to cater to traders' real-time data needs without overwhelming them.

## Outcome

The integration of custom hotkeys and mouse actions has been a game-changer, allowing traders to access a wide range of features rapidly and execute trades swiftly. The application's versatility, extending to both traditional markets and cryptocurrencies, has broadened its appeal. Traders now have a powerful toolkit that enhances efficiency, customization, and ultimately drives greater trading success.
